## About NoodleOps

NoodleOps is a place where I share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge about networking, technology, and other related (or not) topics.

The initial idea was for me to track, document the different projects I have been working on, things that I've learned, experienced, wheteher successful or not. Up until now, I have been using various platforms to write my notes, but I have decided to create a blog to force myself to better document my notes and if they can be useful to others, then that's a bonus.

## About Me

I am a network engineer with a passion for technology, networking, security and automation. I have been working in the IT industry for over 15 years, starting from a junior role as a network engineer, to leading a team of 10 engineers, whilst progressing on my automation journey, and now as a solution architect.

In my current role, my goal is to work with prospect and customer to facilitate the adoption of network automation, and to help them build a more robust, secure, and scalable network.

I am a strong believer in continuous learning, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills, and to learn new technologies. I am a big fan of Python, not as much of Ansible, but still use it more than I would like to admit as it can be very powerful.

## Ideas

I have a few ideas for the blog, but I am always open to suggestions. If you have any ideas, or if you would like me to write about a specific topic, please feel free to reach out to me.

## Contact

You can reach me on LinkedIn, or GitHub. I am always happy to connect with like-minded individuals, and to help where I can.
