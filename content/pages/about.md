## NoodleOps

Welcome to NoodleOps, my personal space for sharing my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge on networking, technology, and other topics that interest me.

The initial idea was to document my journey, track my projects, and reflect on my learnings - both successes and setbacks. Having previously used various platforms to write down notes, I've now decided to consolidate my efforts into this blog, which will not only help me refine my own documentation but also potentially benefit others who may find my experiences useful.

## Me

As a seasoned network engineer with a passion for technology, security, and automation, I've had the privilege of working in the IT industry for over 15 years. My career has taken me from junior network engineer to leading a team of 10 engineers, with a constant focus on automation and innovation. Currently, I work as a solution architect, helping customers adopt network automation and build more robust, secure, and scalable networks.

I am a strong believer in continuous learning, always looking for ways to improve my skills, and to learn new technologies. I am a big fan of Python, not as much of Ansible, but I still use it more than I like to admit, as it can be very powerful.

## Contact

You can reach me on LinkedIn, or GitHub. I am always happy to connect with like-minded individuals, and to help where I can.
