## Introduction

It's meant to be simple to start with, it wasn't as smooth as I thought it would be, but I'm getting there!

## Getting started

I followed the [Hugo Quick Start Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to get started with Hugo.
It was pretty straightforward.

## Theme

Oh my, this was and still is the most challenging part. I've tried a few themes, I think I'm happy with this one, but who knows, I find it hard to make up my mind.
